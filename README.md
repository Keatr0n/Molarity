## Credits

### Periodicity

This project is effectively a fork of [Periodicity](https://github.com/kadinzhang/Periodicity), hence a lot of credit goes to this project as it was the inspiration and the code base for this project. The reason this project is not an actual GitHub fork is partially because of my inexperience with Git and open-source, but also because this project changes periodicity enough to be considered a different project, however, if anyone feels free to mention please open an issue.
